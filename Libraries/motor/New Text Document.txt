/*
This is a header file, denoted by the .h extension. This contains the
declarations for the Motor class, that is the outline of the functionality
which the Motor will implement, but not the actual implementation.

/*
This is a header guard, which prevents us from declaring the class more than
once. The #ifndef directive means that the preprocessor will only parse what
follows if the following flag is undefined. In this case, the first time the
file is inluded _MOTOR_H will be undefined, so the preprocessor will include
the file once. Future attempts to include this file will then find that
_MOTOR_H is already defined, so will skip defining it.
